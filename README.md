# Semantic-HTML

## Descripion

For this project I had four main tasks. I needed to implement semantic tags to make it more accessible. I needed to consolidate and organize the CSS to follow semantic structure. These changes needed to not change the appearance of the webpage. The final thing that was needed was to create a README for the repo.

## technologys

The webpage uses HTML and CSS

## learned

I learned a lot of different semantic tags, how to minimize some CSS, and how to take a screenshot of an entire webpage. 

## Task

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Struggles 

The things that I struggled the most with was not knowing what I should be putting in my README and feeling like the coding was too easy and that I must be missing something.

## Usage
Use the navagation links in the top right to get around the page.
